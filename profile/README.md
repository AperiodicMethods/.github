This organization hosts a research project investigating methods 
for estimating aperiodic activity in neural time series.

To explore this project, see the 
[project website](https://aperiodicmethods.github.io/) and/or the 
[associated preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.15.613114).

This project is maintained by [Tom Donoghue](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/).
