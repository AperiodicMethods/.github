This organization hosts a research project investigating and comparing
methods for estimating aperiodic activity in neural time series.

To explore this project, see the [project website](https://aperiodicmethods.github.io/).

This project is maintained by [Tom Donoghue](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/).
